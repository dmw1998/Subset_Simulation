This repository contains two examples in my master's thesis.

I applied four algorithms -- the classical subset simulation, multilevel estimator, subset simulation with selective refinement and adaptive multilevel subset simulation, on two example problems.

The classical subset simulation algorithm and multilevel estimator algorithm are from _Multilevel Estimation of Rare Events_ written by Elisabeth Ullmann and Iason Papaioannou.

The subset simulation with selective refinement algorithm and adaptive multilevel subset simulation algorithm are from _Adaptive Multilevel Subset Simulation with Selective Refinement_ written by D. Elfverson, R. Scheichl, S. Weissmann, and F.A. Diazdelao.
